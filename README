Responsive Design and OO Javascript Observer Design Pattern

Interesting and difficult test for hardcore front end role at Causata.
I missed the deadline because I was working at CNN but it was such a challenging test that I couldn't resist (almost) completeing it!

Full spec is in the pdf, CausataUI-test.

Part 2 of the test can be viewed [a link] (https://googledrive.com/host/0B-T-DKgvB5MhZThtWnVqTWNiOFE/index-2.html)
